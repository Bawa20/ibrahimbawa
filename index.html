    <!-- PROBLEM SECTION -->
    <section>
        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>The world teaches effort, but hides structure. You were taught to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Work harder</li>
            <li>Be consistent</li>
            <li>Be educated</li>
            <li>Be patient</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Yet many disciplined, hardworking people remain stuck while others advance rapidly with less visible effort. This is not coincidence. It is structure.</p>

    <!-- WHAT THE BOOK REVEALS -->
    <section>
        <h2>What This Book Reveals</h2>
        <p>The Invisible Side of Success exposes the hidden forces that silently shape outcomes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Why hard work alone does not guarantee progress</li>
            <li>The difference between effort and leverage</li>
            <li>Why intelligence fails without structure</li>
            <li>How environment shapes destiny</li>
            <li>Why consistency without direction is dangerous</li>
            <li>How systems outperform talent</li>
            <li>The psychology behind sustained success</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This is not motivation. This is revelation.</p>

    <!-- WHY THIS BOOK IS DIFFERENT -->
    <section>
        <h2>Why This Book Is Different</h2>
        <p>This book does not inspire you but rather it reprograms you. Most books tell you what to do. This book changes how you think.</p>
        <p>Once your perception changes, your decisions change. When your decisions change, your life follows. You will never approach work, opportunity, or effort the same way again.</p>

            <li>You want clarity, structure, and direction</li>
            <li>You want to rise intelligently, not accidentally</li>
